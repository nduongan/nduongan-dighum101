### Course overview
Over the past ten years, the marketing landscape has changed drastically with the emergence of influencers and influencer marketing. This is why I have chosen to intern at a marketing company this summer as an Influencer Marketing intern. Throughout my internship, I have run into several data roadblocks. Platforms such as Tagger and Phlanx have a long time processing social media engagement rates. In addition to their long processing times, I can not help but wonder why these platforms charge users to check user engagement rates. Thus, for my individual project, I want to calculate users' engagement rate across the biggest social media platform, Instagram. 

To calculate a userâ€™s engagement rate, the following key metrics are required: number of posts, number of followers, number of comments, and number of likes. The formula for the engagement rate is 

Engagement =(Total Comments + Total Likes)(Number of Posts   Number of Followers)  100
